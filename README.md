An experiment: A small (unfinished!) JIT-compiled (x86) functional language -- just to see how small it can be.

And I'm sure this can be under 1k lines and still be a real/usable language. But for now it's just a glorified calculator with extra features. 

If you make improvements, please share; that would be kind. :) MIT license, as per header file.
